          <p>
            Slither Classic is a project that combines some of slither.io and
            the classic snake features. It's a game that challenges the best
            of players.

            <h4>Background</h4>
            <p>
              Playing Slither.io was the main reason this project sparked. The
              goal was to create a game that graphically kept the classic
              snake game settings while at the same time add extract
              functionalities similar to slither.io.

            <h4>Project Scope</h4>
            <p>
              Creating Slither Classic involved creating a system for
              displaying text, a grid system correctly positioned that can be
              accessed using X and Y coordinates, and finally spawning food
              that will disappear after a given time.

            <h4>Process</h4>
            <p>
              Like many things, this project appeared simple and
              straightforward, but when put into practice it becomes much more
              complex. 
              <br/>
              Some of the significant development obstacles included
              making the tail of the snake increase upon eating food and
              having a splash text appear the way it does. The splash text
              required me to make a whole new system, which you can view here:
              This game taught me a lot about arrays and handling multiple
              objects that requires a simultaneous update.

            <h4>Background</h4>
            <p>
              As a part of my information technology course, we were tasked
              with creating and solving a real-world problem. I took the
              initiative to identify a problem that existed in the video
              production department. Upon discussion and asking questions I
              realised the video production department needed a software
              solution to deviate from their current paper-based system. It
              was used to track what the student had borrowed and then later
              grabbing the specific forms and manually entering the data on an
              excel sheet. I created the Inventory System to address the
              issue, and as a result, it sped up the process the student took
              when borrowing production equipment.

            <h4>Project Scope</h4>
            <p>
              The core mechanism of the fully-fledged application already
              existed on a paper for their old system. My work was to bring
              the paper-based system online and moreover integrate the data
              into an excel sheet so that it can undergo further confidential
              manipulation.

          </div>
          <div className="col s12 m12 l12 intro">
            <h4>Process</h4>
            <p>
              The Inventory System used technology such as Bootstrap4 for its
              UI, JavaScript for dynamic interaction, Firebase API for storing
              student data and Microsoft VBA for grabbing the data from
              firebase and displaying it on an excel sheet.

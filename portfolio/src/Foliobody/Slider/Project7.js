          <p>
            Defender is a space invader style game. It gives the player the
            challenge of surviving as long as they can without being touched
            by the red balls.

            <p>
              I began the project accidentally when attempting to create image
              tiles in Gravity designer. It became even more of a reason when
              I realised I wanted something to put my new multi-collision
              detection system to use.

            <h4>Project Scope</h4>
            <p>
              While I had a clear thought on how the game was going to work
              down to the functionality due to space invader mechanics. There
              was still the work of integrating my new multi-collision system,
              creating the UI in Gravit designer and creating a CSS explosion
              animation.

            <h4>Process</h4>
            <p>
              Handling multiple enemy movement, keeping projectiles facing the
              same direction from the player to the enemies, making my
              collision system work with the CSS animated explosion were just
              a few of the problems I faced during development. The creation
              of this project taught me a lot especially when it comes to
              arrays and dealing with multiple objects simultaneous. I used
              HTML, CSS and JavaScript for this project.
